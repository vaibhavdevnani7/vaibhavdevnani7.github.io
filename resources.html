                            Written by John Boxall, this book starts with absolute basics and is specifically designed for beginners. It covers everything from leds to gps-receivers.
                            <br>
                            Even though designed for beginners it covers all concepts with full clarity taking all intricacies into account.
                            <br>
                            Available to buy and  download. Or dm me if you want the pdf ; ).

                        <h1>Great Guide to The World of Web Development</h1>
                        <p style="font-size: 95%;">This book is the most straight-forward introduction to HTML and CSS that I have found.
                            And also this was the most beautifully designed coding manual I have ever seen and it was a pleasure to read too.
                            <br>
                            The way this is written, it will take you from absolute basics to very advanced concepts in no time without any confusion. And this website was also designed after reading this book only.

                        <p>Fascinating book which changes your perspective towards a lot of things in life. This book is written by Joshua Foer about his journey exploring the human brain.
                            I recommend watching his <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/U6PoUg7jXsA" style="color: blue;">Ted Talk</a>.

                        <h1>My absolute favourite book for Python so far!</h1>
                        <p>This is one fun book to learn Python, especially for a beginner. First part of the book provides a basic understanding of the language, which done very quickly.
                            Then starts part II, which consists of a number of projects, while diving into certain specific areas relevant to each chapter.
