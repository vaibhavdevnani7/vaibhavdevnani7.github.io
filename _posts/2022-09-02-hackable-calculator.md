I've been working on making a programmable/hackable/scientific calculator which uses a general purpose microcontroller (ESP 32), has the ability to plot graphs, run python scripts, has 2 displays, rotary encoder, maybe mechanical switches, bt, wifi and also extra exposed gpio pins which you can use it to connect with electronics, so it can also be used like TI's inspire series innovator hub.

The goal is to create a fully hackable calculator which can compete with commercially available programmable calculators while costing a fraction of them.
As of now, the extimated cost is around Rs.1800-2000, and it has more features than a TI-84 which costs Rs.12000 something.

I will be updating about further progress here on this blog.
