Worked with a web3 VC Firm Rising Capital to make RISING STARS, it was a platform like ProductHunt where you could discover the latest Web3 projects and products.
I managed the entire codebase of frontend and backend of the website. However, the project got shut down after a while.
The website was powered by a laravel(php) based backend and a html/sass/js frontend.
