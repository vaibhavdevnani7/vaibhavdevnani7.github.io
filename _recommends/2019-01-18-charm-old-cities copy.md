This book is the most straight-forward introduction to HTML and CSS that I have found.
And also this was the most beautifully designed coding manual I have ever seen and it was a pleasure to read too.
The way this is written, it will take you from absolute basics to very advanced concepts in no time without any confusion. And this website was also designed after reading this book only.
